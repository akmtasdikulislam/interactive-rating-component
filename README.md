## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` file and the Google Fonts CDN with `index.html`.
- Then, imported the colors from `style-guide.md` into the `style.css` file. After that, I initialized the css file and set necessary parameters (such as, font-families, colours, font-sizes etc.) for this project.
- Then, I wrote necessary code to reach the given _UI Design Sample_ and also added necessary css styles to match it with the _UI Design Sample_.
- After that, I wrote the necessary CSS MEDIA QUERIES for mobile device view of this project.
- Finally, I wrote necessary `javascript` codes to select ratings, submit ratings and also show "Thank You" state.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
